Simple GO app to compare the size of two directories. I just wanted to be able to monitor the
file copy process while backing up a very large directory, and the native Linux tools for
checking a directory size just aren't fast enough. Wrote this in GO and it seems to work well.

Usage: 
# dirsizecompare -d1=DIR1 -d2=DIR2 [-f]
